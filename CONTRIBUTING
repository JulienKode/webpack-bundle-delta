# Contributing

## Commits
This project has been configured to use [`commitizen`](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) for commits.

Instead of doing `git commit` use `yarn commit` which will call the locally installed `commitizen`.

## Features and fixes

For pull requests:
-	Small contributions (no material impact on the project): no contributor agreement is required and the owner can accept any desired pull requests
-	Material contributions" the contributor needs to sign a [Contributor Agreement](./contributors/ContributorAgreement.txt) before pull requests are accepted
  -	The contributor agreement must be submitted by the contributor via/as part of a pull request to the repo, adding their name (or github handle) to the filename
    > Example:   /contributors/JohnnyCoder.txt
